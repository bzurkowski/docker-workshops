# Managing containers

## Outline

In this chapter you will learn:

* How to run a container from an image.
* How to check containers running in your system.
* How to execute a command in a running container.
* How to access a shell session in a running container.
* How to restart, stop and remove containers.

## Walkthrough

### Task 1: Running containers

In order to run our first container we will use the `docker run` command. It has the following syntax:

```bash
$ docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

`docker run` first takes several options, then a reference to an image from which to create a container, and finally a command with arguments to execute inside the container.

As an example, let's run `ls` command in a container created from `alpine` image ([Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a lightweight distribution of Linux):

```bash
$ docker run alpine ls -l
Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
bdf0201b3a05: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:28ef97b8686a0b5399129e9b763d5b7e5ff03576aa5580d6f4182a49c5fe1913
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
total 56
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Apr  8 20:30 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           340 May  4 10:34 dev
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 May  4 10:34 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Apr  8 20:30 home
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root          4096 Apr  8 20:30 lib
...
```

**Analyze the command output.**

Docker first pulls a missing `alpine` image from a registry using tag `latest`. Then, it creates a container from that image, and executes `ls -l` command inside of the container. Note the result of runnig `ls` command in above output:

```bash
total 56
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Apr  8 20:30 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           340 May  4 10:34 dev
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 May  4 10:34 etc
...
```

Let's run another example:

```bash
$ docker run alpine echo "hello hello hello"
hello hello hello
```

This time Docker reuses already pulled `alpine` image and runs `echo` command in a new container almost immediately.

Note that running a command inside a new container takes less than a second to complete. Imagine booting up a new virtual machine, running the same command and then killing the machine - that would take minutes to complete. This ilustrates how much the containers may be faster than the VMs.

### Task 2: Listing containers

By executing `ls` and `echo` commands we created two containers. We can list them using `docker ps` command:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

The command output is empty, because `docker ps` by default lists only running containers.

Docker keeps a container running as long as the command started inside the container is still running. In our case, the `ls` and `echo` commands exited as soon as the output was written. This means that containers were stopped by Docker daemon.

<!-- Docker doesn't delete stopped containers by default, so they still exist in the `Exited` state. -->

We may force listing all containers regardless of their state by adding `--all` flag to `docker ps`:

```bash
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
2606068544c8        alpine              "echo 'hello hello hâ€¦"   6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 6 minutes ago                       dazzling_raman
e4e9678659e3        alpine              "ls -l"                  6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 6 minutes ago                       unruffled_albattani
```

**Analyze the command output.**

Now, the stopped containers are present in the list. Note their status in the `STATUS` column:

```bash
Exited (0) 6 minutes ago
```

### Task 3: Removing containers

We will no longer need the stopped containers. Let's remove them by passing their IDs to `docker rm` command:

```bash
$ docker rm 2606068544c8 e4e9678659e3
2606068544c8
e4e9678659e3
```

Confirm successful removal by listing containers again:

```bash
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

<!-- After a container is removed Docker frees associated system resources. -->

### Task 4: Interactive shell sessions

So far, we have learned how to run single commands in containers. This method may be convenient if we need to run a service daemon, test new commands or execute an ad-hoc task. However, it is not very useful if we need to perform more advanced operations, e.g., debug a container and preserve contexts of subsequent commands. In such situations, we may need an interactive shell session into the container to interact with the container in the same way as with a regular operating system.

Let's try to run a shell session in a new container:

```bash
$ docker run --interactive --tty --rm alpine sh
```

In order to prevent immediate exit of shell process and stopping the container as in the previous examples, we provided the following additional options to `docker run` command:

* `--interactive` to forward local `stdin` into the container (interactive session),
* `--tty` to allocate a pseudo-terminal.

Additionaly, we used `--rm` to tell Docker to automatically remove the container after its done with executing the session.

After the container starts the Docker engine switches user context into the bash shell inside the container. Input and output streams are bound between the local session and the shell session in the container.

Let's run several sample commands inside the container:

* List files in the current directory:

  ```bash
  $ / # ls
  bin    dev    etc    home   lib    media  mnt    opt    proc   root   run    sbin   srv    sys    tmp    usr    var
  ```

* Check hostname:

  ```bash
  $ / # hostname
  5f676173f668
  ```

  By default, hostname of a container is equal to its ID. What is the hostname of host OS?

* Check information about operating system:

  ```bash
  $ / # uname -a
  Linux 5f676173f668 4.9.125-linuxkit #1 SMP Fri Sep 7 08:20:28 UTC 2018 x86_64 Linux
  ```

  Check the output of the same command on your host OS.

* Try to run `apt` package manager:

  ```bash
  $ / # apt
  sh: apt: not found
  ```

  `apt` is present in the host OS (Ubuntu) but it is not present in Alpine Linux. Alpine supplies a different package manager:

  ```bash
  $ / # apk
  apk-tools 2.10.3, compiled for x86_64.

  Installing and removing packages:
    add       Add PACKAGEs to 'world' and install (or upgrade) them, while ensuring that all dependencies are met
    del       Remove PACKAGEs from 'world' and uninstall them
  ...
  This apk has coffee making abilities.
  ```

  Install `figlet` package:

  ```bash
  $ apk install figlet
  ```

  Play with filget:

  ```bash
  $ figlet "HELLO WORLD"
  ```

Exit the container shell:

```bash
$ / # exit
```

Try to run `figlet` on Docker host:

```bash
$ figlet "HELLO WORLD"
The program 'figlet' can be found in the following packages:
 * figlet
 * toilet
Try: sudo apt install <selected package>
```

The `figlet` command is not present on the host, because it was installed only in the container.

Ensure that the container has been automatically removed (`--rm` option):

```bash
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

### Task 5: Running containers as daemons

It is totally correct to run containers without specifying a command to run inside a container. Most Docker images come with a default command defined in a Dockerfile.

E.g., the [official image for Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) defines the following default command in its [Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/redis/blob/dcc0a2a343ce499b78ca617987e8621e7d31515b/5.0/Dockerfile#L84):

```dockerfile
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

It starts Redis daemon in the foreground since this is what most users would do with the image - start the Redis service.

Let's run a Redis container without specifying a command:

```bash
$ docker run redis
1:C 04 May 2019 15:34:53.491 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
1:C 04 May 2019 15:34:53.492 # Redis version=5.0.4, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=1, just started
1:C 04 May 2019 15:34:53.492 # Warning: no config file specified, using the default config. In order to specify a config file use redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
1:M 04 May 2019 15:34:53.495 * Running mode=standalone, port=6379.
1:M 04 May 2019 15:34:53.495 # WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 511 cannot be enforced because /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn is set to the lower value of 128.
1:M 04 May 2019 15:34:53.495 # Server initialized
1:M 04 May 2019 15:34:53.496 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
1:M 04 May 2019 15:34:53.496 * Ready to accept connections
```

**Analyze the command output.**

Docker executes the default command, which starts the Redis server and then starts populating log entries to the `stdout`.

This may not be the most effective way to start containers with long-running processes such as Redis or Nginx servers, because they block the current user session. We would have to every-time run a new terminal session to start a new container.

Stop the Redis container blocking our current session by hitting `ctrl` + `^c`:

```bash
^C1:signal-handler (1557003118) Received SIGINT scheduling shutdown...
1:M 04 May 2019 20:51:58.619 # User requested shutdown...
1:M 04 May 2019 20:51:58.619 * Saving the final RDB snapshot before exiting.
1:M 04 May 2019 20:51:58.648 * DB saved on disk
1:M 04 May 2019 20:51:58.648 # Redis is now ready to exit, bye bye...
```

Docker enables running containers in the background by passing `-d` (detached) flag to `docker run`. Let's run another Redis container, but this time move it into the background:

```bash
$ docker run -d redis
511f41395ff8d87639030df2fa1848121e142168fcce9bec30b58fc50ab5c6bd
```

Verify that container is running:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
511f41395ff8        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   1 minute ago        Up 1 minute         6379/tcp            focused_mendel
```

### Task 6: Naming containers

Take another look at the output of `docker ps` command:

```bash
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
82f58fddd99c        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   16 seconds ago       Up 14 seconds               6379/tcp            clever_wright
bb5ed1224665        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Exited (0) 59 seconds ago                       keen_almeida
```

**Analyze the command output.**

Each container has an ID and a name which are generated randomly every time a new container starts.

It is a good practice to name containers with concrete and meaningful values. First, it is easier to refer such containers in subsequent Docker commands. Second, containers can be referenced by name in a Docker network - important for service discovery in multi-container applications.

In order to assign a name to a container there is `--name` option for `docker run` command. As an example, let's create a container from Nginx image and name it `mynginx`:

```bash
$ docker run --name mynginx -d nginx
```

List containers to verify the name:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
14e9ac152299        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   5 seconds ago        Up 2 seconds        80/tcp              mynginx
82f58fddd99c        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   6379/tcp            clever_wright
```

### Task 7: Executing commands in running containers

Until now, we have been able to execute commands in a container by providing them as an argument to the `docker run` command or by launching an interactive session.

How to execute the command when the container has already been started?

To run a command in a running container, we can use the `docker exec` command. It has the following syntax:

```bash
$ docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
```

Similarly to `docker run` command, `docker exec` takes options, as well as command with arguments to execute in the container. However, instead of a reference to an image, it takes a reference to a running container.

Let's execute `cat` command in the running Nginx container to fetch configuration of Nginx server:

```bash
$ docker exec mynginx cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
...
```

Note that we referenced container by its name (`mynginx`).

Also, `docker exec` can be used to run an interactive bash session in the running container:

```
$ docker exec --interactive --tty mynginx bash
$ root@ef5fe670c3dd:/# cd /var/log/nginx/
$ root@ef5fe670c3dd:/var/log/nginx# ls
$ access.log  error.log
$ root@ef5fe670c3dd:/var/log/nginx# cat error.log
$ exit
```

### Task 8: Restarting containers

At some point, we may want to stop some of the containers to temporarily release the system resources (memory, processor) and start other containers, while retaining the ability to restart the stopped ones.

`docker stop` command enables to stop a container process. The memory and processor resources are then released, while the container data is still persisted on the disk. Later, it is possible to restart the stopped container process using `docker start` command. It starts the container process with a default command or a command initialily specified in `docker run` command.

List all running containers:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
14e9ac152299        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        80/tcp              mynginx
82f58fddd99c        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        6379/tcp            clever_wright
```

Stop containers running Redis and Nginx servers:

```bash
$ docker stop mynginx
mynginx
$ docker stop 82f58fddd99c
82f58fddd99c
```

Confirm that containers have been stopped:

```bash
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
14e9ac152299        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   5 minutes ago       Exited (0) 16 seconds ago                       mynginx
82f58fddd99c        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 12 seconds ago                       clever_wright
```

Restart the Nginx container:

```bash
$ docker start mynginx
mynginx
```

Confirm that the container has started:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
14e9ac152299        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   5 minutes ago       Up 4 seconds        80/tcp              mynginx
```

## Exercises

1. Stop and remove all containers (including the stopped ones).
2. Run a new container with `Redis` version `4.0.14` in the background, name it `myredis`.
3. Run a new container with `MariaDB` version `10.1` in the background, name it `mymariadb`.

  **Hint:** First, try to run the container in the foreground to detect eventual startup issues. Additional option may be required to successfully run the container - use [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run) to find it.

  Container started successfully if the following entry is present in the log output:

  ```
  2019-05-04 21:19:14 140606575032320 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
  ```

  Use `--rm` flag to prevent multiple stale containers. If unable to exit the container, use `docker kill CONTAINER` command in a new terminal session to terminate the container.

4. Fetch configuration of `MariaDB` server from the running `mymariadb` container using interactive bash session. The configiration is located in file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`.
5. Fetch `Redis` logs from the running `myredis` container. It should be located in the `/var/log/redis` directory.
6. Add a file in an arbitrary location in `myredis` container. You can use `touch` command to accomplish that.
7. Restart `myredis` container and check if the created file still exists.
