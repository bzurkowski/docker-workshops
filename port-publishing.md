# Port publishing

## Outline

In this chapter you will learn:

* Why do we need to publish container ports.
* How to publish container ports.

## Walkthrough

### Task 1: Why do we need publish container ports

By default containers do not publish any ports to the outside world. Ports are opened only for internal container-to-container communication in a Docker network. In order to access container ports from the outside of the container, ports must be published explicitly via `docker run` command. The objective of this task is to ilustrate the problem.

Let's run a container with Nginx:

```bash
$ docker run --name noportpub -d --rm nginx
```

List the created container:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
dc8defc10363        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   11 seconds ago       Up 9 seconds        80/tcp              noportpub
```

**Analyze the command output.**

The container exposes port `80` for internal `HTTP` communication (`PORTS` column).

Let's try to communicate from the Docker host with the Nginx server running in the container:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:80
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused
```

The connection has been refused, because firewall rules prevent communication to port `80` in the container from the ourside of a Docker network.


### Task 2: Publishing container ports

In order to publish a container port there is `--publish` flag for `docker run` command. It has the following syntax:

```bash
--publish HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT
```

It defines a mapping between `HOST_PORT` and `CONTAINER_PORT`. Multiple instances of this option can be provided to define mapping for multiple container ports.

As an example, let's run a container with Nginx and publish port `80` to the outside:

```bash
$ docker run --name portpub -d --rm --publish 8080:80 nginx
```

We've mapped port `8080` of the Docker host to port `80` of the container. This means, that all communication to port `8080` on the host will be forwarded to port `80` in the container. Also, appropriate firewall rules are set to permit the communication.

Once again try to communicate with the Nginx server from the Docker host:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>For online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at
<a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

This time the communication succeed. You may also try to access Nginx via the web browser by entering the same URL.

## Exercises

1. Run a `Redis` container with port `6379` exposed by the container mapped to port `6000` on the Docker host.
2. Install `redis-cli` on the host to access the Redis service from *the outside*:

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install redis-tools
  ```

3. Connect to containerized Redis instance from the Docker host:

  ```bash
  $ redis-cli -h localhost -p 6000
  ```
