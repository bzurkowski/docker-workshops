## Outline

In this chapter you will learn:

* How to install Docker into your system

## Walkthrough

Update the `apt` package index:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Install additional packages required for Docker installation:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Setup the stable Docker repository:

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

Update the package index:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Install Docker packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Check the installed Docker version:

```bash
$ sudo docker version

Verify the installation:

```
$ sudo docker run --rm hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

**Docker is now installed and running.**

Try to run a Docker command without `sudo`:

```bash
$ docker run --rm hello-world
```


<!-- Note that we must prepend each Docker command with `sudo`


The docker group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps. -->
